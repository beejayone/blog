As an idea for the next #HomeCon (Homecomputer & Console Meetup) i came up with setting up an Atari ST #MiSTer setup, which runs Cubase 3.1 and controls a MIDI device, preferrably a synthesizer or a groovebox. I did some research and found, that with some USB-To-MIDI adapters it should be possible to simulate the original MIDI interface using the MiSTer UART interface. i'm curious how this works out!
