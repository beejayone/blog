Wow, this is super cool! I donâ€™t even need to use a cracked version of Cubase, because the #AtariST core of #MiSTer offers a virtual Dongle for that software ðŸ¤¯
MIDI can be used via USB instead of the UART connector, which is super convenient. So my random shitty USB-to-MIDI adapter which came with a preowned Korg Volca FM finally comes in handy!
Now up to obtain a Roland MC-101 for the ultimate compact all-in-one-soundstation-including-retrosounds experience :)
